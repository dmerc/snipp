Code/text snippets for the command line

Tired of IDE dependent snippet plugins ? Here is a pure bash solution.

Snipp uses pygments to highlight syntax, and supports 8 or 256 color terminals.

Use `snipp help` for documentation, its very simple

tested only on linux but should work in any bash environment.
